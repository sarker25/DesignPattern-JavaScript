### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and design. It is a fundamental principle that promotes good software design and maintainability

### The [SRP]("Single-Responsibility-Principle") says that

> A class should have only one reason to change
>
> > A class should have a single responsibility or a single job. It should encapsulate and represent one specific piece of functionality within your program.

#### Some Keypoints of Single Responsibility Principle

- Separation of Concerns

  > By adhering to SRP, separate different concerns or responsibilities into different classes. This makes codebase more modular and easier to understand because each class has a well-defined purpose.

- Easier Maintanance
  > When a class has only one responsibility, changes related to that responsibility are isolated to that class. This makes it easier to maintain, test, and modify code without affecting unrelated parts of the system.
- Reusability

  > Classes with a single responsibility tend to be more reusable because they are highly focused on one specific task. This can lead to greater code reusability across different parts of application.

- Readability
  > Code that adheres to SRP is generally more readable and understandable since each class has a clear and concise purpose.
