### Open Close Principle

---

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and design. It was introduced by Bertrand Meyer in 1988 and is a fundamental concept for writing maintainable and extensible code

The [OCP]("Open-Close-Principle") says that

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
>
> > Essentially, this approach encourages to create software in a way that allows to add additional functionality or behavior to a module without changing its original source code. This means that after a module (such as a class) is developed and put through testing, it shouldn't be changed to accommodate new features or adapt to requirements changes. Instead, should add new classes or elements to the module.

#### Some Keypoints of Open Close Principle

- Extension through Inheritance or Interfaces
  > Normally use inheritance (for classes) or interfaces (for interfaces) to create new subclasses or implement new interface implementations in order to achieve the "open-for-extension" component. Without changing the old code, these new classes can add or override methods to introduce new behavior.
- Avoids Fragile Base Class Problem
  > Coding changes have the potential to introduce errors and reduce the software's stability. The "fragile base class" issue, in which modifications to a base class have an adverse effect on its subclasses, is avoided in part by the OCP
- Easier Maintanance
  > Even as incorporate new features, any existing code that depends on the original module still functions properly. This is essential for complex software systems with many clients and developers.
- Promotes Design Patterns
  > Design patterns like the Strategy Pattern and the Decorator Pattern, which offer practical solutions to implement the idea, are strongly tied to the OCP.

### State Space Explosion

> State space explosion, also known as the "combinatorial explosion" or "combinatorial complexity," is a term used in computer science, artificial intelligence, and formal methods to describe a phenomenon where the number of possible states or combinations in a problem or system grows exponentially as the problem size or complexity increases. This exponential growth in the state space can lead to significant computational challenges and can make certain problems or systems difficult or even infeasible to analyze, model, or solve using traditional methods.
